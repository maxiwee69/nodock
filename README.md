A dock remover, yes. Another one. but my first ever public tweak/programm or anything. i know its a lame thing but will 
push out more updates in the future. I am currently only able to test it on ios 16.3.1 with fakefs(root(non-rootless))
i will shortly look into supporting rootless, i cant tell you stuff about ios compatibilty but as i said it works on ios 16.3.1
if you have problems or anything tell me on twitter(@maxiweee69), if you dont want to use twitter/cant use it my reddit names are Maxiwee and KeyCurrency4412. If you have some feature request or anything tell me! i will shortly look into 
adding some preferences to change the docks color.
